Our flagship Harpoon IPA and our Leviathan Imperial IPA are two of our favorites. We thought it was about time to take a crack at the Black IPA style.\r\n \r\nHarpoon brewer Matt DeLuca took over the brewhouse for our 40th 100 Barrel Series offering. A newly released specialty malt from Briess called Midnight Wheat gives this beer an almost stout-like appearance without the overly roasty attributes often associated with traditional dark malts. Flaked barley is also used in the malt bill for head retention. An intense yet diverse hop addition schedule is executed during the boil that results in a well balanced offering.\r\n \r\nOn top of the Chinook, Simcoe, Cascade, and Citra hops is an ample addition of Ahtanum hops that provides a fruity aroma to complement the earthy, spicy bitterness of this dark ale.\r\n \r\nBrewed on: 12/15/11\r\nPackaged on: 1/5/12 \r\n \r\nBREWED BY\r\nHarpoon Brewer Matt Deluca\r\n \r\nAVAILABLE FROM \r\nJanuary 2012 to ....
